Overview
This project implements a supervised regression model to predict house prices. It explores how variables like location, area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities, and more affect housing costs. The goal is to build an accurate, explainable model using Python's ML libraries. Examples of similar workflows can be found in other Kaggle‑style house price projects 


Dataset
Sourced from Kaggle / public housing data (e.g., Ames, Hyderabad, California) 


Contains features such as: Location, Size (sq ft), Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot Area, Year Built, etc.

Target variable: SalePrice.

Features & Preprocessing
Missing data handling: Imputation or dropping columns with excessive nulls 
Hugging Face

Categorical encoding: One-hot / label encoding of features like Neighborhood, HouseStyle

Feature scaling: StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for numerical variables

Feature engineering: Derived features (e.g. Age = CurrentYear – YearBuilt) to capture richer patterns

Modeling Approach
Models examined:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor – popular for structured tabular tasks 


Pipeline setup: Sequential flow of preprocessing → feature engineering → model

Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters

Model Evaluation
Metrics used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² (R‑squared)

Example: Achieved RMSE of X on test set, indicating an average error margin of X units

Visuals: Scatter plot of predicted vs actual prices / residual plots

Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
# If hosted on GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/House‑Price‑Prediction.git
cd House‑Price‑Prediction
Ensure required packages are installed via requirements.txt or a Conda environment.

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
For prediction:

Load the trained model (.joblib / .pkl)

Prepare new house data in the same feature format

Use model.predict(...) to estimate the price
